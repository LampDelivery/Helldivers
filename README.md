### ALERT TO ALL HELLDIVERS
Transmission from Super Earth Command - Briefing

Citizens! Your interface has been compromised by inefficiency and undemocratic heresy. But fear not—Super Earth has authorized the deployment of the Helldivers Discord Theme!

- Background: A tactical blend of deep black and reinforced steel gray, evoking the hull of a Hellpod mid-drop.
- Accent Colors: Glorious golds and symbols of valor, sacrifice, and orbital superiority.
- Fonts: Bold, utilitarian typefaces approved by the Ministry of Readability. No cursive. No nonsense.
- Notifications? Recast as priority alerts from Super Earth HQ.

This theme doesn’t just reshape Discord—it liberates it. Every scroll, click, and emoji is now a salute to democracy. You’re not chatting. You’re coordinating planetary liberation.

Install it. Deploy it. Spread it.  
Because freedom isn’t free—it’s color-coded, mission-stamped, and ergonomically optimized.

For Super Earth. For Interface Discipline. For Democracy.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you would like your discord to look exactly like the preview, make sure to have the following plugins installed:

## CompactMode (optional but I absolutely recommend it)
- Double check that "Hide Avatar" is disabled
- Hide Reply icon enabled

## HighlightOwnMessages (also optional)
- Right and Left enabled
- Left Align Multiline disabled

<sub><sup>Terms and Conditions Apply:  
This theme may induce uncontrollable urges to shout “FOR SUPER EARTH!” in voice channels. Side effects include increased tactical awareness, spontaneous stratagem deployment, and intolerance for bugs, bots, and bureaucrats. Super Earth is not responsible for friendly fire incidents, orbital miscalculations, or accidental liberation of furniture. Use responsibly. Obey without question. Glory to Managed Democracy™.</sub></sup>
