### ALERT TO ALL HELLDIVERS
Transmission from Super Earth Command – Democracy Officer Briefing

Citizens! Your interface has been compromised by inefficiency and aesthetic heresy. But fear not—Super Earth has authorized the deployment of the Helldivers Discord Theme!

- Background: A tactical blend of deep black and reinforced steel gray, evoking the hull of a Hellpod mid-drop.
- Accent Colors: Glorious golds and symbols of valor, sacrifice, and orbital superiority.
- Fonts: Bold, utilitarian typefaces approved by the Ministry of Readability. No cursive. No nonsense.
- Icons: Replaced with mission-grade insignia—each ping, DM, and server switch now feels like a call to arms.
- Message boxes mimic encrypted transmission consoles.
- Notifications? Recast as priority alerts from Super Earth HQ.

This theme doesn’t just reshape Discord—it liberates it. Every scroll, click, and emoji is now a salute to democracy. You’re not chatting. You’re coordinating planetary liberation.

Install it. Deploy it. Spread it.  
Because freedom isn’t free—it’s color-coded, mission-stamped, and ergonomically optimized.

For Super Earth. For Interface Discipline. For Democracy.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you would like your discord to look exactly like the preview, make sure to have the following plugins installed:

## CompactMode (optional but I absolutely recommend it)
- Double check that "Hide Avatar" is disabled
- Hide Reply icon enabled

## HighlightOwnMessages (also optional)
- Right and Left enabled
- Left Align Multiline disabled
